## 💡 About

Hi! Here is Chao Yang. I mainly focus on common Computer Vision topics including object detection and image segmentation, etc. Currently I'm working on autonomous driving tech including perception, HD map and stuff.

When I'm free, I enjoy [📖 reading](https://book.douban.com/people/TKBJ/), watching [🎬 movies](https://movie.douban.com/people/TKBJ/) and [📺 anime](https://bangumi.tv/user/525235), and listening to [🎧 music](http://music.163.com/m/user/home?id=93476860). I also work on useful/useless side projects from time to time.

If you're interested, please checkout my personal [✏️ blog](https://blog.diycat.top/) where I share my ordinary yet joyful life.
